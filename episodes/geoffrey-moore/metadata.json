    "Target segments must be big enough to matter, small enough to lead, and a good fit with your crown jewels",
    "Pragmatists buy what they see their peers buying - social proof is essential for crossing the chasm",
    "Visionaries make poor references for pragmatists because they operate differently and create messes pragmatists have to clean up",
    "You know you've crossed the chasm when you can survive without more venture funding - cashflow positive is the key metric",
    "Each market phase requires a different playbook - using the wrong playbook in the wrong phase has opposite effects",
    "Before crossing the chasm, focus on problem domain knowledge, not product demos or features",
    "The compelling reason to buy comes from customer pain, not your compelling reason to sell",
    "Start with one marquee customer for credibility, then find a beachhead segment of pragmatists with urgent problems"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "The tendency when you're in the chasm is, 'I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find,' because we need revenue. It's like taking a match and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log.",
    "Before the chasm, the customers you work with are people who say, 'We believe what you believe.' After the chasm, they say, 'I'm not sure about that, but we need what you have.'",
    "If you're gifted enough to be able to start a software company and do something original, you're a scarce resource, so don't waste it."
