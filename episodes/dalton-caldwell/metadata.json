    "The core startup advice is simply 'don't die' - most successful startups went through multiple near-death experiences",
    "Good pivots move toward your expertise ('warmer') and build on what you've learned, not away from it",
    "Founders should spend 20-30% of their time talking to customers in person, not hiding behind analytics",
    "Avoid 'tarpit ideas' - concepts that seem good and get positive feedback but consistently fail",
    "Don't over-delegate or hire senior executives too early; founders must stay close to product and customers",
    "The primary cause of startup failure is founders losing hope, not running out of money",
    "Market size (TAM) matters less at early stages than execution and finding product-market fit",
    "Successful founders have unshakeable internal belief that they will make it work, regardless of external feedback"
