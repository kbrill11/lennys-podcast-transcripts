  "key_insights": [
    "70% of Calendly's signups come through viral loops when users send scheduling links to others",
    "Internal transfers are often the most successful path into product management - seek opportunities to shadow and partner with PMs",
    "Clear product strategy that defines 'where to play' and 'where not to play' is crucial for prioritization and team effectiveness",
    "Moving from PLG to sales-led growth requires hiring different sales profiles - inbound-focused 'growers' rather than outbound 'hunters' initially",
    "Product development should commit to phases you can control (discovery, solutioning) rather than promising delivery dates 6 months out",
    "When sending Calendly links, open with asking for their availability first, then offer your link as an alternative to reduce awkwardness",
    "Focus wisely by saying no to features that don't serve your target personas - even popular requests like Venmo integration",
    "Having product and design report to the same leader helps ensure integrated end-to-end user experience thinking"
