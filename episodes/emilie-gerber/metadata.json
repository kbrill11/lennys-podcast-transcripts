  "key_insights": [
    "For B2B companies, press provides second-order benefits like third-party validation, sales enablement, and recruiting support rather than direct growth impact",
    "Position your company as taking on established incumbents rather than creating new categories - it gives reporters immediate context",
    "Keep funding announcement pitches simple: amount raised, investors, one line about why it matters - avoid convoluted messaging",
    "Offer exclusives to reporters and be willing to follow up respectfully 3-4 times before moving on",
    "Cold outreach done well is just as effective as warm introductions - relationships help get responses but don't influence editorial decisions",
    "Most effective pitches are three sentences or less - longer pitches tend to perform worse",
    "Use controversial or contrarian angles to stand out among similar pitches on trending topics"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "No one ever gets this tactical in PR. There's just so much theoretical conversation and examining the big blunders, but at the end of the day, if you're a startup that wants to get coverage for your company, you need to know actually the steps to take to do it.",
    "I'm of the belief that it does not matter as much as many people think it does... any good reporter is not going to be making their editorial decisions based on who their friends are.",
    "You can get so in the weeds with your own messaging that you want to set up this massive problem statement, you want to make it a huge trend story, but if you're very straightforward and you're pattern matching, it's generally actually going to work."
