  "key_insights": [
    "PMs should avoid hoarding credit, playing telephone between stakeholders, and dismissing technical details to maintain good relationships with engineers",
    "Engineers need creative outlets in product decisions, or they'll find them in unnecessary technical rewrites and over-engineering",
    "Major system rewrites are often traps that underestimate migration complexity and hidden business logic in legacy systems",
    "Engineering managers should achieve technical mastery (around 10 years) before transitioning to management to maintain credibility",
    "Platform teams need software engineers, product managers, and outcome-based metrics - not just DevOps/SRE roles",
    "Working fewer focused hours with regular audits of priorities often produces better results than long work weeks",
    "Effective delegation requires upfront teaching investment but creates scalability and team empowerment",
    "One-on-ones should be reserved for direct reports and managers, not used as default stakeholder management"
