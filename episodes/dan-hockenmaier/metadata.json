  "key_insights": [
    "50% of a growth model's value comes from building it - forces understanding of how business works",
    "Retention is typically more impactful than acquisition but harder to move - focus on early user experience",
    "Marketplaces require 'gardener' approach with light touch vs 'construction worker' approach of SaaS",
    "Demand aggregation is ultimately what matters most - supply follows strong demand",
    "Liquidity (reliability of marketplace) is the critical metric before anything else matters",
    "Share of wallet indicates depth over breadth and creates defensibility through reduced multi-tenanting",
    "Unbundling opportunities are rarer than thought - scale benefits usually outweigh UX improvements",
    "Newer marketplaces charge higher commissions by doing more work in the value chain"
