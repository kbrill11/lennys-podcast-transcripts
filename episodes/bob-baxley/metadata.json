    "Design should report to engineering to ensure better integration and implementation, treating design as phase zero of the engineering process",
    "Wait as long as possible to draw pictures or create prototypes to avoid the 'primal mark' problem where teams gravitate toward the first visual solution",
    "Design tenets (decision-making tools) are more valuable than design principles (platitudes) - they should help resolve recurring debates",
    "Software is a medium that elicits emotional responses, and builders have a moral obligation to put positive emotional energy into people's lives",
    "Company culture around design must exist from the founding DNA - it cannot be grafted on later",
    "Give designers clear constraints and context (like a detailed AI prompt) to enable faster, more focused work",
    "Small teams (4-24 people) are optimal for creating breakthrough products - larger teams struggle with scenius and coherent vision",
    "When changing companies, hold onto values but adapt behaviors to fit the new culture"
