  "key_insights": [
    "Choose the harder path because even if you fail, you learn more and work with smarter people than taking the easy route",
    "Pair programming is the most underutilized management tool in engineering - two people on one computer write better code faster",
    "Create intensity through weekly updates (GSD), six-week reviews, and regular check-ins rather than expanding work hours",
    "Delete code regularly - Shopify has a 'Delete Code Club' and routinely removes millions of lines to improve maintainability",
    "Think platform-first: build infrastructure that enables anyone to build features in one hour rather than building point solutions",
    "Hire through job trials and internships rather than traditional interviews - work product over resume evaluation",
    "Micromanagement isn't bad if it means pairing on problems rather than just checking status",
    "Everything you know might be wrong - maintain beginner's mind and experiment constantly"
