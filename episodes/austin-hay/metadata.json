  "key_insights": [
    "Tools are meant to solve problems - don't pick tools based on familiarity, focus on the specific problem you're solving",
    "Think 'build AND buy' instead of 'build vs buy' - combine third-party tools with custom solutions for optimal results",
    "Set up attribution infrastructure from day one by collecting first and last touch UTM parameters, even if you start with simple attribution models",
    "MarTech becomes necessary around 100-150 employees when village-style tool management no longer scales",
    "Use the PPS framework: Problem, People, System - understand the problem and people involved before jumping to system solutions",
    "Design systems with 1-2 year future state in mind to avoid costly migrations later",
    "Probabilistic attribution is becoming essential as deterministic matching becomes harder with iOS 14+ and cookie restrictions"
