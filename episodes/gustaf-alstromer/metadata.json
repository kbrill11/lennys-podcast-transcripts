    "Having a technical co founder is critical because so many decisions are technical and require iteration",
    "Climate tech has shifted from impact focused to economically driven with trillions in transition money",
    "Strategy doesn't matter for early stage startups - only execution and clear priorities",
    "Group office hours create accountability and reduce founder loneliness through peer learning",

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "If I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters.",
    "I have an idea for a song, I just need a musician to help me make it - that's kind of similar to how it is with engineering.",
    "Don't ever ask a founder how they're doing or how it's going. It just creates all this anxiety because nothing's ever going great."
