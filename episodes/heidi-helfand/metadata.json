    "Teams naturally evolve through five patterns: one by one (joining/leaving), grow and split, merging, isolation, and switching",
    "Transparent reteaming with whiteboard visualization allows employees to see opportunities and provide input on organizational changes",
    "Isolation teams with process freedom and executive protection are highly effective for innovation and new product development",
    "Switching team members regularly builds knowledge redundancy and prevents single points of failure in systems",
    "High performing teams cannot be replicated by simply spreading their members across other teams",
    "Change is inevitable in growing companies, so organizations should focus on getting better at managing transitions rather than avoiding them",
    "The RIDE framework (Requester, Input, Decider, Executor) provides clarity on decision making roles during organizational changes"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "Reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer, so let's focus there too.",
    "Sometimes you have that awesome team situation. It's an enjoyable experience. People are learning. But the thing is, it is different, and our companies go through stages. Nothing lasts."
