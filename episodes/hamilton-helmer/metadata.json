    "Power requires both a benefit (cost or price advantage) and a barrier (durability against competitors)",
    "Only four of the seven powers are typically available to early stage startups: counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs, and network economies",
    "Operational excellence is critical for achieving competitive position but rarely constitutes actual power since it can be mimicked",
    "Network effects are common but network economies (material impact on pricing power) are rare",
    "Founders should think about power from day one, not just after achieving product market fit",
    "Business value is driven by only three things: power, market size, and operational excellence",
    "Counter positioning is usually the starting power for most successful startups",
    "Many companies confuse having network effects with having network economies as a source of power"
