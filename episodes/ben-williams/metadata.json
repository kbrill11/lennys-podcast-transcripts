    "Start with narrow, deep focus before expanding - Snyk focused solely on Node.js developers initially to validate product-market fit",
    "Build growth loops into the product from day one - Snyk's GitHub integration created automatic PR fixes that served as both value delivery and acquisition",
    "Growth teams need balanced cross-functional structure including growth marketers embedded within product teams",
    "Activation metrics should focus on habit formation around core value delivery, not just feature usage",
    "Institutionalize learning sharing through regular impact and learning review meetings to maximize experiment value",
    "For developer products, meet users in their workflow rather than pulling them out of it",
    "Product-driven revenue (meaningful product usage before sales contact) leads to higher net retention",
    "Invest early in trustworthy behavioral data infrastructure and event tracking schemas"
