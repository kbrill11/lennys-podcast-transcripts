  "key_insights": [
    "Only 5% of emerging channels work, so evaluate channel DNA, company fit, and customer overlap before investing",
    "Start by assuming you no longer have product-market fit in changing economic conditions - your entire customer base may have changed",
    "Growth CMOs need to operate like product managers with data-driven iteration and experimentation across all marketing functions",
    "Depression vs burnout can be distinguished by motivation patterns - burnout affects work energy while depression impacts all activities",
    "The 'Yes, and...' principle from improv creates better collaboration by building on ideas rather than rejecting them",
    "Early adopters are often drastically different from broad audiences - map out what signals indicate broader market fit",
    "Marketing and product should be married at the hip in modern product-driven companies, not separate functions",
    "Emerging channels work best when their strengths align with customer needs and company goals"
