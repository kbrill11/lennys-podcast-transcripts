  "key_insights": [
    "Operations and product teams work best as 'twin turbine engines' - both needed for optimal performance, not competing functions",
    "Starting in operations provides deep customer understanding that makes for better product leadership",
    "In low-volume businesses, run power analysis before A/B testing to avoid false precision - sometimes trust intuition when data isn't feasible",
    "Jobs-to-be-done framework is most valuable when it forces deeper customer empathy, not as rigid template adherence",
    "Product reviews should focus on making products better, not just accountability - keep under 10 people for best conversations",
    "Staying calm under pressure is learnable through experience and helps teams perform better than reflecting stress",
    "Finding the 'kernel of truth' in ambiguous signals is core to product management - write down all ideas but focus on what really matters",
    "Competition awareness is important but customer focus matters more, especially in large underserved markets"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "Uber always has this mentality and Opendoor does two of the product operations, twin turbine jet plane where you can fly the plane on one engine for a little bit if you need to, but it's operating most efficiently and effectively if both are working together.",
