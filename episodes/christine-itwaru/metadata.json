  "key_insights": [
    "Product ops is both a system/process and a role - companies can implement product ops practices without necessarily hiring dedicated people",
    "The main value of product ops is giving PMs back quality time with customers by handling internal alignment and stakeholder management",
    "Product ops emerged as a natural evolution when product teams scaled and CPOs took on broader business responsibilities beyond just product delivery",
    "Successful product ops professionals should focus on automating processes and moving to more strategic work rather than maintaining manual tasks long-term",
    "The quality of questions product teams receive from sales/success teams is a key indicator of whether you need product ops support",
    "Product ops differs from product marketing by focusing on internal education and understanding rather than positioning and selling",
    "Engineers participating in customer meetings can dramatically improve product development decisions and team confidence",
    "Most successful product ops leaders come from product management backgrounds, while individual contributors often come from consulting, customer success, or technical roles"
