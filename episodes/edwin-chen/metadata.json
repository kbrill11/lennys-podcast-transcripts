    "Quality trumps quantity in AI training data - understanding nuanced, subjective quality metrics is crucial for model performance",
    "Companies can achieve massive scale (billion+ revenue) with tiny teams by focusing on elite talent rather than headcount",
    "Bootstrapping allows founders to optimize for product excellence rather than VC expectations and PR metrics",
    "Current AI benchmarks are misleading - they reward superficial improvements over real-world performance",
    "Human evaluation through expert annotators provides more accurate model assessment than automated benchmarks",
    "Reinforcement learning environments that simulate complex, multi-step real-world scenarios are the next frontier in AI training",
    "AI model behavior increasingly reflects the values and objective functions of the companies building them",
    "Building something only you could build based on unique expertise is more valuable than following standard startup playbooks"

    "We essentially teach AI models what's good and what's bad. People don't understand what quality even means in this space.",
    "I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, we are optimizing for AI slop instead.",
    "Don't pivot. Don't blitz scale. Don't hire that Stanford grad who simply wants to add a hot company to your resume, just build the one thing only you could build."
