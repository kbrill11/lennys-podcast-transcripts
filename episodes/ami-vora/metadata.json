  "key_insights": [
    "Respond to disagreements with curiosity rather than defensiveness - say 'fascinating, tell me more' to unlock learning opportunities",
    "Execution beats strategy every time - customers care about the product in their hands, not your five-year plan",
    "Use metaphors and analogies to create shared narratives that align teams without micromanaging decisions",
    "Avoid 'toddler soccer' by giving teams different goals that ladder up to the main company metric",
    "Product reviews should establish principles for future decisions, not just make individual choices",
    "As you get more senior, you only see unsolvable problems - leadership is choosing the least bad option",
    "Follow emotional instincts about where you feel 'at home' rather than spreadsheet analysis for career decisions",
    "Bring recommendations, not just data, to leadership meetings - executives have 'dinosaur brains' and can only hold three facts"
