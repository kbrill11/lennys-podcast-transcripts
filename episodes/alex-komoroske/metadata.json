    "LLMs are 'magical duct tape' that makes writing software cheaper but running it more expensive, fundamentally changing cost structures",
    "Think like a gardener not a builder - plant seeds that can grow on their own rather than trying to control every outcome",
    "Organizational kayfabe (things everyone knows are fake but acts like they're real) emerges naturally and compounds up organizational layers",
    "The adjacent possible is smaller than we think - focus on actions within arm's reach that definitely work, then iterate",
    "Taste becomes the key differentiator when AI can produce most content - stand out by having a perspective different from what an LLM would generate",
    "Create 'strategy salons' or nerd clubs with 'yes, and' energy to generate emergent insights in low-stakes environments",
    "Always rules are better than sometimes rules for self-control and building sustainable habits",
    "Do things that give you energy AND that you're proud of - this combination creates sustainable high performance"
