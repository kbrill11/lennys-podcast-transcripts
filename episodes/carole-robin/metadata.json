    "The 15% rule: step slightly outside your comfort zone to build deeper relationships without reaching the danger zone",
    "Anger is a secondary emotion - underneath it is usually fear or hurt, which are connecting emotions rather than distancing ones",
    "Stay on your side of the net when giving feedback - focus on observable behaviors and your feelings, not attributions about the other person's intent",
    "Use the formula: 'When you do X (behavior), I feel Y (emotion), and I'm telling you this because Z (desired outcome)'",
    "Ask questions starting with what, when, where, how - avoid 'why' questions which make people defensive",
    "Appropriate vulnerability makes leaders stronger, not weaker, by allowing others to see them as human and trustworthy",
    "Address pinches before they become crunches - deal with small irritations before they escalate",
    "Giving advice often hinders relationships - being a thought partner and asking questions is more effective"
