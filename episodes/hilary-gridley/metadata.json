    "When facing criticism or setbacks, focus on actions that demonstrate the opposite of what you fear others think about you rather than trying to argue or explain",
    "Understanding how key stakeholders think is more valuable than knowing what they think - build mental models of their decision making frameworks",
    "Use 'magic questions' (statements ending with 'do you agree?' or 'is that right?') to quickly understand another person's mental model",
    "Create habit formation through consistency, reduced friction, and powerful immediate emotional rewards",
    "AI can dramatically accelerate learning by providing on demand feedback and unlimited practice opportunities",
    "Product leaders should focus on operationalizing the CEO's vision rather than trying to impose their own",
    "Behavioral activation (taking action to improve mood) is more effective than waiting to feel better before acting",
    "Reward loops need to be powerful, immediate, and emotional to drive lasting behavior change"
