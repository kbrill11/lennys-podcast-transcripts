    "Product management skills can only be developed through real work with real customers and data - exercises and homework aren't sufficient",
    "Career acceleration follows a loop: execute → generalize learnings → communicate effectively → scale opportunities",
    "The transition from IC to manager often fails due to a 'death spiral' where managers keep the best work for themselves",
    "Successful PMs understand their work 'two stack levels up and down' - knowing their boss's boss's priorities and technical implementation details",
    "Sponsorship (someone giving you bigger opportunities) is more impactful than mentorship for career growth",
    "Product leaders must own business outcomes and marshal resources, not just optimize with what they're given",
    "There are four types of product work: feature work, growth work, product-market fit expansion, and scaling work",
    "Senior operators are increasingly choosing portfolio careers over traditional full-time roles"
