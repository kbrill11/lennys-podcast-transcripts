  "key_insights": [
    "In marketplaces, supply is almost always the critical constraint - you can't have a business without inventory on the shelves",
    "Consistency and predictability of content creation is crucial for creator success, along with collaboration with other creators",
    "Musicians often struggle with the 'starving artist ethos' and shy away from monetization more than other creators",
    "Start building relationships with potential acquirers from day one, not when you're ready to sell",
    "Treat company acquisition like a managed process similar to fundraising - it rarely just happens organically",
    "Focus on de-risking your biggest, most innovative ideas first rather than always choosing safe, predictable wins",
    "Creators need two fundamental things: audience growth and monetization - audience growth often enables monetization opportunities",
    "The creator economy prediction largely came true, but platforms won due to network effects and aggregation advantages"
