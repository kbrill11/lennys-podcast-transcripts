  "key_insights": [
    "Focus on understanding your best customers (those who get value, pay, are happy, and remember life before your product) rather than trying to optimize for all users",
    "Traditional funnels fail because they put businesses at the center instead of customers and don't account for post-acquisition retention and expansion",
    "Map customer journeys through struggle, evaluation, and growth phases with measurable KPIs for each milestone",
    "Better qualified customers from improved messaging can increase trial-to-paid conversion even without touching the product experience",
    "Use customer research to identify which product features deliver the most value, then front-load those in onboarding",
    "Jobs-to-be-done focuses on what customers are trying to accomplish rather than demographic data",
    "Create proactive and reactive customer experiences to help users reach value milestones and catch them when they fall off",
    "Voice-of-customer research can be done efficiently in 2-3 weeks with surveys, avoiding analysis paralysis"

    "The problem with funnels and pirate metrics... is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same.",
    "You want to reflect them back to them. That is what is going to show them that you understand the problem that they have and that your product has exactly what it is that they need.",
    "We often talk about it and describe it as the story of how I met and fell in love with your product."
