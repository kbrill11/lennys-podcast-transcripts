  "key_insights": [
    "A good name will help a startup, but a bad name won't kill a good company - focus on building great products and marketing over perfect naming",
    "Positioning should come before any marketing work - if 10 customers describe your product differently, you have a positioning problem",
    "Use the 'bar test' for positioning - you should be able to explain your product naturally in conversation at a bar",
    "Brand personality needs tension to be interesting - define attributes as 'we are X but not Y' to avoid blandness",
    "For PR, don't do straight funding announcements - use funding as a news hook to tell a larger story about product availability or customer momentum",
    "Target the most specific audience possible initially - it's better to own a niche than try to be everything to everyone",
    "The three pillars of brand development are Purpose (why you exist), Positioning (how customers understand your product), and Personality (how you show up)",
    "Hire a marketer around 10 people when you have repeatable processes and multiple marketing problems that need ongoing attention"

    "A good name is only going to help you, but a bad name won't hurt a good company... Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good if I just put it in a spreadsheet, but they grew over time.",
