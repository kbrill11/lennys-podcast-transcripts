    "Evals are becoming the new product requirement documents - if the model is the product, evals define what success looks like",
    "The fastest growth comes from finding leading indicators in rapidly changing markets where wealthy customers pay whatever it takes",
    "Focus on elastic demand industries (software, product management) where 10x productivity increases create 100x more demand rather than displacement",
    "Success requires being stubborn about your thesis of how the world will change but flexible about the exact form it takes",
    "High-performing companies need three pillars: can-do attitude (ambitious goals), high standards (exceptional talent), and intensity (output-focused culture)",
    "The shift from crowdsourced low-skill labor to expert professionals represents a fundamental change in how AI models are trained",
    "Market pull is more valuable than forced product-market fit - look for customers that are surprisingly easy to sell to",
    "Learning to leverage AI tools effectively is becoming as important as domain expertise itself"
