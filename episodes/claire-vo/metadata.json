    "Know what you want in your career, be clear about it, and make it easy for your boss to help you get there by solving company problems",

    "The universe is bendable to your will - organizations are fluid and can be reorganized around talented, motivated individuals",
    "Clear feedback is kind - conflict-avoidant cultures degrade talent bars and don't help people succeed",
    "AI will likely replace lowercase 'c' communication (functional information trading) but not capital 'C' communication (influence, boldness, charisma)",
    "CPTO roles combining product and engineering work when you have a leader who can optimize for the whole organization rather than individual functions",
    "Focus on your zone of genius - where you're exceptional, where no one else can do the job as well, and where you derive joy"
