  "key_insights": [
    "In tech categories, one company typically earns 76% of total market value while others fight for the remaining 24%",
    "Category design is about creating demand rather than competing for existing demand in established markets",
    "The 'better trap' - trying to win by being incrementally better in existing categories - is a path to failure",
    "Problems create categories, not products - focus on reframing problems rather than building better solutions",
    "Languaging (strategic use of language) is crucial for changing how people think about problems and solutions",
    "Lightning strikes (concentrated marketing efforts) are more effective than 'peanut butter' spread-thin approaches",
    "Product-market fit is dangerous because it assumes fitting into existing markets rather than designing new ones",
    "Super consumers (8-10% of buyers) drive most profits and act as thought leaders in categories"
