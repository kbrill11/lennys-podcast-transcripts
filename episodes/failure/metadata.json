  "key_insights": [
    "Fail conclusively to ensure learning - design experiments to maximize treatment effects so failures provide clear lessons rather than ambiguous results",
    "Trust must be earned before implementing change - coming in listening rather than swinging prevents team rebellion and builds foundation for transformation",
    "Focus on user problems, not solutions - attachment to specific implementations often leads to missing the real underlying issues customers face",
    "Unit economics must work from the beginning - magical thinking about scale fixing fundamental business model flaws leads to expensive failures",
    "Dogfooding prevents obvious mistakes - testing your own products before shipping helps catch issues that seem obvious in retrospect",
    "Career resilience comes from embracing both A-side and B-side moments - everyone has failures between highlights, and recognizing this builds long-term perspective",
    "Public failure is survivable and often educational - even walking off stage in front of thousands can be recovered from and become a learning experience"
