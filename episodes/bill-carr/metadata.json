  "memorable_quotes": [
    "We took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow.",
    "Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. Most people confuse speed with velocity, and the difference between the two is that velocity has both speed and a vector to it.",
    "You want to create a product funnel, not a product tunnel. With a funnel, meaning lots of things at the top, fewer things at the bottom."
