    "40-60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision due to buyer indecision, not product inadequacy",
    "Sales pitches should focus on teaching customers how to buy rather than overwhelming them with features",
    "The most effective pitch structure has two parts: setup (insight, alternatives, perfect world) and follow-through (differentiated value, proof, objections, ask)",
    "Buyers' biggest fear is making a bad decision that could hurt their career, not missing out on new technology",
    "FOMO tactics actually make indecisive customers less likely to buy by increasing their stress",
    "Most legendary businesses did not create new categories but started as niche plays in existing categories",
    "Differentiated value answers 'why pick us over alternatives' and should drive the entire sales narrative",
    "Cross-functional teams (product, marketing, sales) working together on positioning creates better outcomes than siloed approaches"
