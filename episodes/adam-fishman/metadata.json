    "Onboarding is the only product experience 100% of users touch and represents the first chance to deliver on brand promises",

    "Onboarding improvements can shift retention curves by 10-20 percentage points by focusing on habit formation",
    "Use proxy metrics instead of waiting 90 days to measure onboarding success - look for early velocity indicators",
