    "Product led growth is fundamentally data led growth - without usage data and analytics foundation, you're giving away free product for nothing",
    "The biggest difference between sales led and product led funnels is that usage becomes the leading indicator for success rather than marketing campaign interactions",
    "Activation is usually the best starting point for most B2B software adding PLG because historically they weren't designed for quick time to value",
    "GitLab's activation milestone was two users using two features in 14 days, discovered through correlation analysis of conversion and retention rates",
    "Most companies fail at PLG because they think launching a free trial equals PLG, without considering the entire motion and required infrastructure",
    "A full funnel audit going through the user journey as a potential customer reveals major low hanging fruits in most PLG implementations",
    "Data instrumentation and establishing a data dictionary should come before investing in analytics tools",
    "Initial PLG teams should start with a growth PM and data analyst as the core foundation before adding engineers and designers"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "PLG I always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. If you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing.",
    "I'm a big fan of finding leverage. If you can always find the area that with relatively small investment can give you the biggest results, that can be such momentum.",
    "Do is better than show is better than tell - you want to remove all the frictions and somehow give them a warm start with sample templates they can play with initially."
