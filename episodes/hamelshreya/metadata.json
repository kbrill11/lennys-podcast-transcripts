  "key_insights": [
    "Error analysis should always precede building automated evaluations - start by manually reviewing actual user interactions to understand real failure modes",
    "Most eval failures come from skipping data analysis and jumping straight to writing tests without understanding actual problems",
    "LLM as judge evaluators should be binary (pass/fail) rather than multi-point scales to avoid ambiguity and improve actionability",
    "The benevolent dictator approach - having one domain expert lead the evaluation process - is more effective than committee-based approaches",
    "Code-based evaluators are preferred over LLM judges when possible due to lower cost and higher reliability",
    "Evals are most valuable when used for both pre-production testing and ongoing production monitoring",
    "Theoretical saturation - continue data analysis until you stop discovering new types of problems - typically occurs around 100 traces",
    "Product managers should be heavily involved in the eval process since they understand the user experience and business requirements"

    "To build great AI products, you need to be really good at building evals. It's the highest ROI activity you can engage in.",

    "People have been burned by evals in the past. People have done evals badly, so then they didn't trust it anymore, and then they're like, 'Oh, I'm anti evals.'"
