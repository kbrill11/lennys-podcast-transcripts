  "key_insights": [
    "The brain has three main systems (safety, reward, purpose) that can be intentionally activated for better outcomes",
    "Meetings should start with priming (context setting) before decision-making to be effective",
    "Professional relationships depend on three factors: ability, trust, and appeal - with appeal being most important biologically",
    "Focus exists in three brain wave states: alpha (daydreaming), beta (productivity), gamma (deep thinking) - teams should spend ~25% of time in alpha/gamma",
    "Personality differences (particularly openness and conscientiousness) significantly impact how people approach vision and strategy work",
    "Company culture should be built through logical deduction from your role in the world, not inspirational mission statements",
    "Influence works best when you choose a character/approach that aligns with your personality strengths",
    "Self-awareness about your cognitive biases and limitations is crucial for effective collaboration"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "The brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it. Most people rely on their history department way too much.",
    "It's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience?",
    "There's a mismatch between what science knows and what business does. In that gap, it says, 'Well, what is it that business is doing that science knows better?'"
