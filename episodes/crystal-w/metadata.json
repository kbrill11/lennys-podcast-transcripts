  "key_insights": [
    "Run experiments with as few as 30 users - the data trends remain consistent even with small sample sizes, though precision improves with scale",
    "For free products, aim for 60% week-1 retention that flattens after 2-3 weeks; paid products should target 20-30%",
    "Focus on solving trust and friction issues before optimizing for conversion - address the step before users make decisions",
    "Do things that don't scale initially - rent stadiums, use WhatsApp groups, create Wizard of Oz experiences to validate hypotheses",
    "Most analytics efforts fail because teams track measurements instead of insights - instrument properties into events to understand the 'why' behind user behavior",
    "Copy optimization can be the biggest lever for early-stage products - tie unfamiliar products to familiar concepts",
    "Add pause/snooze features instead of just cancel options to reduce churn for subscription products",
    "Growth teams should focus on filling obvious gaps rather than trying to figure out growth strategy from scratch"

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "If someone told you in the US that they were going to rent out a stadium, pre-load a bunch of mobile devices... some people would say 'No. That's crazy.' But this concept of doing things that are somewhat crazy, but validate a point, doing stuff that don't scale, is really the bread and butter of what we did at Gojek.",
    "Do not treat metric gathering as entertainment. Real news is information that changes what you do in the real world. If you don't change what you're doing, what you are doing is just getting entertainment.",
    "Everyone wants to go on retention... but they don't realize that users make decisions based on succeeding events. So what's one step before the user makes that decision?"
