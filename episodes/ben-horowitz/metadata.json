    "Success comes from a series of small, hard decisions that compound over time, not from single breakthrough moments",

    "CEOs should judge people on their strengths and what they can do, not their weaknesses or past failures",
    "Product management is fundamentally a leadership job where you must influence without authority",
    "Confidence is the key differentiator between successful and failed founders - loss of confidence leads to hesitation and political dysfunction",
    "In AI, application layer companies need to build specialized models and proprietary data to create real moats, not just thin wrappers",
