    "Use 'Curiosity Loops' - ask 5-10 people specific, unbiased questions to get contextual advice instead of relying on one person's opinion",
    "Apply the 'explore and exploit' framework in early career - explore different roles/industries to learn, then exploit what works",
    "Define personal values through structured exercises to make better decisions aligned with your authentic self rather than external expectations",
    "Don't be the 'boiling frog' - regularly assess if your current situation is trending positively or negatively for your growth and learning",
    "Most people don't need a coach - exhaust alternatives like mentors, courses, and communities first before investing in coaching",
    "Practice 'eating your vegetables' - force yourself to do difficult but important things 10-12 times before deciding you don't like them",
    "Use the five-minute rule for productivity - commit to just five minutes on your most important daily task to overcome procrastination",
    "Working with a romantic partner requires clear domains of responsibility and the ability to engage in constructive conflict without taking feedback personally"

    "It's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there.",
    "Don't be the frog. If you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive.",
    "We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them."
