    "Think of marketing as fuel (content, messaging, positioning) and engine (distribution, channels, operations) - identify which constraint is bigger before hiring",

    "Product marketers should understand the product, audience, and market to communicate the right things at the right time",
    "Marketing teams should focus on impact goals (conversion rates, qualified leads) rather than activity goals (number of blog posts)",
    "Clear Areas of Responsibility (AOR) lists prevent confusion and improve cross-functional collaboration",
    "Great marketing requires both strategic thinking and scrappy execution - avoid hiring senior people who only worked at large companies",
