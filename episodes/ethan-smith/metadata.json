  "key_insights": [
    "AEO requires being mentioned frequently across citations rather than just ranking #1, unlike traditional SEO",
    "Early-stage companies can win at AEO quickly through citations, whereas SEO typically requires established domain authority",
    "LLM traffic converts 6x better than Google search traffic due to higher intent and conversational priming",
    "Reddit optimization works best through authentic participation rather than spam - identify as yourself and provide genuine value",
    "AI-generated content doesn't work for ranking - only 10-12% of top results are AI-generated despite 50%+ of web content being AI-created",
    "The 'long tail' of questions is much larger in chat (25 words avg) vs search (6 words), creating new opportunities",
    "Help center optimization is crucial for AEO since people ask specific feature/integration questions",
    "Answer tracking requires measuring share of voice across multiple LLMs and question variants, not just single rankings"
