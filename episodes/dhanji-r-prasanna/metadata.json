  "key_insights": [
    "Moving from GM structure to functional organization was key to becoming more AI-native and tech-focused",
    "AI tools are saving 20-25% of manual hours across all teams, with engineering teams reporting 8-10 hours saved per week",
    "Non-technical teams using AI programming tools showed the most surprising productivity gains",
    "Code quality has little correlation with product success - focus on solving real problems for users",
    "Start small with everything rather than trying to 'boil the ocean' - successful products like Cash App and Goose began as small experiments",
    "Leadership should use AI tools themselves daily to understand their capabilities and limitations before rolling out to teams",
    "Conway's Law is powerful - you ship your org structure, so organizational design directly impacts outcomes"

    "A lot of engineers think that code quality is important to building a successful product. The two have nothing to do with each other.",

    "If you're not waking up in the morning feeling energized about what you're going to do that day in your professional life, then change something, quit if that's what it comes down to."
