    "AI was considered a 'dirty word' by tech companies as late as 2016, showing how rapidly perceptions can change",
    "The combination of big data (ImageNet), neural networks, and GPUs created the foundation for modern AI",
    "World models represent the next frontier in AI by enabling spatial intelligence and 3D world understanding",
    "Robots need to understand 3D actions in 3D worlds, making them fundamentally different from language models",
    "Being intellectually fearless and focusing on mission over every job dimension is crucial for career impact",
    "AI development should prioritize human dignity and agency rather than just productivity gains",
    "The 'bitter lesson' of AI (simple models with more data beat complex models) may not fully apply to robotics",
    "Every person, regardless of profession, has a role to play in AI's development and governance"
