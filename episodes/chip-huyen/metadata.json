    "Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news? If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more.",
    "We are in an ideal crisis. Now, we have all this really cool tools to do everything from scratch... but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build.",
    "CS is about system thinking, using coding to solve actual problem and problem solving will never go away because what AI can automate more stuff, the problem is just get bigger."
