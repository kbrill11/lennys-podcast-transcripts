  "key_insights": [
    "Building deep technology first can pay off massively if you survive long enough to find the right use case",
    "AI coding tools work best when compute runs locally in the browser rather than on cloud servers for speed and reliability",
    "Non-technical product managers are often more successful with AI coding tools than developers because they excel at articulating requirements",
    "Small, long-tenured teams with high context can scale much faster than large teams with frequent turnover",
    "The deterministic nature of code makes it ideal for AI training compared to other domains like law",
    "Daily all-hands meetings for the entire company can be effective during periods of extreme growth to minimize communication loss",
    "Anthropic's Claude Sonnet was the breakthrough model that made reliable AI code generation possible",
    "AI coding represents a fundamental shift from human-first to AI-first development with human assistance"
