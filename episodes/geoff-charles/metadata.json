    "Velocity enables teams to reach impact through iteration - teams with high velocity can get to meaningful outcomes faster",

    "Context over control works when you align on goals, hypotheses, and data interpretation rather than prescribing solutions",
    "Every support ticket should be viewed as a product failure - having support report to product creates accountability",
    "A-plus engineers want to win in the market, understand the business, and proactively solve problems beyond their assigned scope",
    "Planning should focus on high-value accuracy needs (like major market moments) while accepting chaos in lower-stakes areas",
    "Writing forces first principles thinking - start with a clear question and think through the answer before researching solutions",
