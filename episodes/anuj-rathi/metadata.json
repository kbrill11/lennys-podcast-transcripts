    "Users are lazy, vain, and selfish - design onboarding experiences with this mindset",

    "Always explore three divergent strategic options before committing to one direction",
    "Focus on new/marginal users rather than existing users when optimizing experiences",

    "In marketplaces, traditional OKRs fail because goals across user types are inherently conflicting",

  "memorable_quotes": [
    "There are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem.",
    "Users are lazy, they are vain, and they're selfish. So lazy meaning, 'I don't have time for this, so blow my mind away. Otherwise, I'm not going to pay attention.'",
    "You are the reason for your own misery. Stop externalizing."
