  "key_insights": [
    "Don't hire a head of growth until you have solid product-market fit and significant data volume - founders should lead growth initially",
    "If your business growth is declining, hiring a growth team won't fix the underlying product or market issues",
    "Homepage redesigns and rebrands typically hurt performance initially and require 3-6 months of optimization to recover",
    "Focus 20-25% of growth team time annually on building owned/earned channels rather than relying entirely on paid acquisition",
    "Testing everything creates paralysis - use pre/post analysis for low-traffic areas and reserve A/B tests for high-impact, high-volume initiatives",
    "Your growth problems aren't unique - talk to people who've solved similar issues rather than starting from scratch",
    "Diversify growth models every 18 months and expect to need new major growth engines every 5 years",
    "Career optionality should be the north star rather than chasing specific titles or roles"
