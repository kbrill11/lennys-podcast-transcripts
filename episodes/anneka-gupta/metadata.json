    "Being strategic means articulating a compelling 'why' behind decisions and championing difficult but necessary changes for long-term success",
    "Transform challenging situations by reframing them as learning opportunities and finding ways to make them fun",
    "Make decisions with 70% information rather than waiting for perfect data - you learn more by committing and iterating",
    "When giving hard feedback, explicitly state you care about the person's success and frame issues as perception problems rather than character flaws",
    "Navigate difficult personalities by understanding their motivations and finding ways to align their interests with your goals",
    "Effective summarization in meetings is viewed as strategic thinking - synthesize discussions and check for alignment",
    "Manage energy levels throughout the day rather than just managing time - schedule difficult tasks during peak energy periods",
    "The easiest path into product management is transitioning from another function within the same company where you already have credibility"
