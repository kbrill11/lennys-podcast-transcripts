    "Strategy sits between mission/vision and roadmap, forcing choices to deploy scarce resources for maximum impact",
    "Use a 5-stage process over 8-12 weeks: preparation, strategy sprint, design sprint, document writing, and rollout",
    "Form a strategy working group with engineering, product design, and data to create collaborative ownership",
    "Generate problems first, cluster them, flip to opportunities, then rank on 4 criteria: impact, certainty, clarity of levers, and differentiation",
    "Conduct leadership interviews early to avoid the 'fruit story' - understanding preferences before building strategy",
    "Strategy has no business value until tested through execution - be ready to pivot based on results",
    "Run small-S (2-year, problem-focused) and big-S (5-10 year, aspirational) strategy work in parallel",
    "AI can assist with competitive analysis and mock strategy generation, but human judgment still needed for focus and context"
