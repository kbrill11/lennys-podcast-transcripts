    "New distribution platforms follow a predictable 4-step cycle: conditions met, moat identification, platform opening, platform closing for monetization",
    "ChatGPT is positioned to become the next major distribution platform due to superior retention, engagement, and context/memory moat",
    "Startups must choose one platform and go all-in rather than spreading resources across multiple bets",
    "Companies that set hard constraints (like limiting headcount until AI adoption is proven) see the most success in AI transformation",
    "The window for capitalizing on new distribution platforms is getting shorter, requiring faster decision-making",
    "Platform cycles are inevitable - companies should plan entry and exit strategies from the beginning",
    "AI adoption requires addressing the slowest part of the system, often IT, legal, or procurement processes",
    "CEOs are often disconnected from actual AI adoption happening at ground level in their organizations"
