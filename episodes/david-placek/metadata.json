    "Great names create discomfort initially - if your team is comfortable with a name, you probably don't have the right one yet",
    "Look for polarization in team reactions as a sign of name strength, not consensus",
    "Focus on behavior and experience rather than descriptive qualities when naming",
    "Use the 'competitor test' - ask people how they'd react if a competitor launched with your proposed name",
    "Generate 1,000+ name ideas before evaluating - suspend judgment and speculate on potential",
    "The .com domain is less important now - it's become like an area code",
    "Asymmetric and cumulative advantage come from distinctive names, not descriptive ones",
    "Each letter of the alphabet has specific psychological associations and vibrancy levels"
